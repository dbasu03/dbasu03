## Hi, I'm Deepayan

I work across quantitative modeling, machine learning and software engineering.  
My focus is on building efficient systems, understanding data-generating processes and writing code that behaves well under constraints.  
Most of my projects sit at the intersection of algorithms, statistical reasoning and performance-sensitive engineering.

I care about clarity, correctness and reproducibility in what I build.

## Work & Interests

I’ve explored diffusion models for image enhancement, implemented custom U-Net variants and trained on datasets like Haze4K under various sampling and stability constraints.  
Before that, I worked on retrieval-augmented NLP pipelines that transformed natural language into business workflows.

Outside of ML, I build tools and systems in Java, Python and C++, often leaning on competitive programming instincts—segment trees, dynamic programming and other low-level algorithmic structures.  
I enjoy quantitative problems as well: simulation, time-series behavior, noise and small experimental alphas.

My goal is to combine solid engineering practice with careful mathematical thinking.
